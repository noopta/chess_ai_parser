# Chess Parser with AI Analysis
In this project, I aim to develop a program which can get a user's most recent games played from Chess.com, and scrape the set of moves per game. The data is then fed to GPT 3.5 for game analysis, highlighting the selected user's weakness and providing resources and topics to study which will help defeat the user.
